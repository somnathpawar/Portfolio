AWS provided several methods for connecting to your running EC2 instances. They are EC2 instance connect (only for public IP instances),
Systems Manager Session Manager, and bastion hosts. AWS recently announced a new service called <b>EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint</b> in June 2023,
 which essentially delivers better security and lower costs than previous options. In this tutorial, we will look at the benefits of using
  it as well as how to build EIC endpoints and use them to initiate connections.

Many AWS customers still use public IP addresses on the necessary resources when remotely administering resources inside their VPCs from
 the Internet, or at best a bastion host strategy combined with long-lived SSH keys. Using public IPs can be partially restricted by using
  IGW routes and/or security groups. These controls, however, can be difficult to handle in a dynamic environment. As a result, careful
  management of long-lived SSH keys remains the single layer of defence, which isn't ideal because we all know that these safeguards
  occasionally fail, thus defense-in-depth is essential. Although bastion hosts might be useful, they considerably raise the operational
  overhead of administering, patching, and sustaining infrastructure.

## EIC Endpoint overview
With EIC Endpoints, customers can have remote connectivity to their instances in private subnets, eliminating the need to use public IPv4
addresses for connectivity. EIC Endpoint eliminates the cost and operational overhead of maintaining bastions. EIC Endpoint combines AWS
 Identity and Access Management (IAM) based access controls to restrict access to trusted principals, with network based controls such as
 Security Group rules, and provides an audit of all connections via AWS CloudTrail, helping customers improve their security posture.

## How to create EIC endpoint
Only one endpoint is required per VPC. To create or modify an endpoint and connect to a resource, a user must have the required
IAM permissions, and any security groups associated with your VPC resources must have a rule to allow connectivity.
Refer to the following resources for more details on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/eice-security-groups.html" target="new">configuring security groups</a> .
You can create AWS EIC endpoint through AWS console or CLI. For Console, you can refer the official documentation <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-ec2-instance-connect-endpoints.html#create-eice" target="new">here</a>.

## Creating an EIC Endpoint with the AWS CLI
To create an EIC Endpoint with the AWS CLI, run the following command, replacing <b>[SUBNET]</b> with your subnet ID and <b>[SG-ID]</b> with your security group ID:
```js
aws ec2 create-instance-connect-endpoint \
    --subnet-id [SUBNET] \
    --security-group-id [SG-ID]
```
It will take around 4/5 minutes to create this endpoint and make it available.

## How to connect to the instance using EIC endpoint
Assume that I have created an instance into my private subnet. That instance's security group has been considered to allow SSH access
from EIC endpoint security group and VPC CIDR range.
Now, you get two options for connecting to the private instance using your EIC endpoint.endpoint
- AWS Console:
    AWS has provided a GUI to make the connection:

- AWS CLI Client<br/>
    You can use `aws ec2-instance-connect ssh` command. By default, it picks your EIC endpoint available into your VPC subnet in which your
     instance is running.

## Conclusion

EIC Endpoint offers a safe way to access to your instances through SSH or RDP on private subnets without the use of IGWs, public IPs,
agents, or bastion hosts. You can securely connect to your VPC by configuring an EIC Endpoint with your existing client tools or the
Console/AWS CLI. Visit the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Connect-using-EC2-Instance-Connect-Endpoint.html" target="new">EIC Endpoint documentation</a> to learn more.
